# DirectLinks for Chrome

This extension circumvents certain techniques some websites used by, such as Google or Linkprice.

## What does this extension do?

[한국어 설명](http://macnews.tistory.com/3663)

As described. Some websites are probably tracking what you're doing right now or what page you're looking at, by when you click a link to get other page you may need. On the other hand, they may slow down reaction rate of your browser as they make an unnecessary HTTP request.
So anyway, this enables you to be free from them by changing the target URL in a link tag when you click a hyperlink.

## How do I get started?

This extension works perfectly with Chrome and Firefox, other browsers are not tested yet but support some browsers which support [WindowBase64 helper](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowBase64) and have UserScript plugin.
